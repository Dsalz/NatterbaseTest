## Natterbase Node Test

###Instructions for app usage
- Clone repo 
- Open folder
- Run "npm install" to install dependencies
- Run "npm start" to start server
- App is now served at http://localhost:4000
- When passing token add token to request header under key "Authorization" in the format 'Bearer <-token->'
- NB: /server contains ES6 Files and /build contains the files transpiled down to ES5 so if there is no /build file run "npm run build"
